# AGEnix Website

This directory will contain the source for the AGEnix public website.

Recommended approach:

- Use a static site generator (e.g. Docusaurus) backed by the `/docs` directory.
- Publish via GitHub Pages from this repo (or a dedicated `gh-pages` branch).
- Link prominently to component repositories and their implementation details.

For now this is a placeholder; the site scaffold can be added in a later step.
