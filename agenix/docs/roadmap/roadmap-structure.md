# Roadmap Structure and Governance

The AGEnix roadmap is managed centrally and spans multiple repositories.

## Sources of Truth

- **GitHub Projects** at the `agenix-sh` organisation level provide a cross-repo roadmap and backlog.
- This repository (`agenix-sh/agenix`) contains human-readable roadmap documents and release notes.

## Linking from Component Repos

Each component repo (`agx`, `agq`, `agw`, `agx-ocr`) should link to:

- the organisation-level GitHub Project used as the roadmap,
- the relevant sections of this documentation that describe current and future work.

Roadmap items should be tracked as GitHub issues, grouped into initiatives and releases.
